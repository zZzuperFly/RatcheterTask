a small msbuildtask that compares some input and log the result
it is at this moment not even close to beeing done - the finished version will use xml-files both as input/output and reporting 
hopefully it will be done soon


This is just a test but a bit of a tip on how to run the project.

It is written in C# .net 4 and the solutionfile and all used dlls are included
it contains tests written in nUnit, specFlow and uses rhino mocks for fakes.
autofac is included but not used yet ( I am not familiar with the tool and it just don´t fit into my workflow yet)

running debug will read from the projfile included in the project and tries to find both it and msbuild in hardcoded places
